This article is part of the series Arch Linux in a VMware Workstation. In the second article I will explain to you how I get my scripts into virtual machine and execute them.
Configuration I use:

* Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop
* VMware Workstation Pro 15

For this article to follow along, I assume that you have completed the article Setup the virtual machine to continue.

Steps in this article: 

* Accessing the VM from a terminal.
* Synchronize the time.
* Install git
* Download the repository
* Prep and execute the scripts
* Admire the results

Now we can ssh into this virtual machine from our host machine:

```bash
ssh root@172.16.157.183
```
