By default the Azure Portal uses the settings as is commonly used in the USA. This means that for the date the notation `Month/Day/Year` is used and for the time the `AM/PM` suffix is used in combination with the 12hour notation.

For me personally this is not what I am used to. The date notation I like to use is Year-Month-Day and for time the 24hour notation.

The Azure Portal let's you change the format of how the date and time is displayed. Unfortunately not fully customizable, but close enough for now.

For me changing the settings to `Nederlands (Nederland)` creates a workable compromise. It displays the date as `Day-Month-Year` and more important time as `24hour` notation.

Of course you can use the setting that works best for you.
